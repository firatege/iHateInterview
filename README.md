# 😎 iHateInterview: Real-Time Emotion Detector

Welcome to the project where your face tells all! (And your code does the rest.)

## What is this?
A Python app that:
- Looks at your face (with your permission, promise!)
- Reads your expressions using MediaPipe's FaceLandmarker
- Predicts your emotion with a machine learning model
- Tells you if you look happy, sad, or just... neutral

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo. (You know the drill)
2. Install requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make sure you have a webcam and a face (preferably your own)
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. Make faces. See what the machine thinks. Try not to laugh (or do, it's good for the data).

## FAQ
- **Q:** Why is it called iHateInterview?
- **A:** Because interviews are stressful. This project is not. 😁

- **Q:** Why does it say 'No blendshapes detected'?
- **A:** Maybe you're a robot. Or maybe check your camera/model setup.

- **Q:** Can it detect if I'm lying?
- **A:** No, but it can tell if you're frowning about it.

Made with caffeine, Python, and a little bit of facial confusion. 👀
